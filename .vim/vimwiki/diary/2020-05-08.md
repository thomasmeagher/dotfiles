Create a structure like this:

```
[
    {
        type: 'heading',
        from: x,
        to: x,
        attrs: { level: 1 }
        marks: [
            { from: x, to: y, type: 'strong' }
        ]
    },
    {
        type: 'paragraph',
        from: x,
        to: x,
        marks: [ ... ]
    }
]
```

Then apply them in a loop:

1. Remove marks
2. Set block type; check for active node
4. Add marks; check for active mark
