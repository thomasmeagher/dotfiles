Looked into [profiling
vim](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/vim/profiling.md) so I could
get a baseline measurement into performance. Everything looked okay.

Recording various other CLI tools for Vim, tmux, etc. I have tried:
* [`vim-vinegar`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar), liked that it was
  light-weight and worked with `netrw`, but was difficult to use
* Tried to use [`skhd`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd) (hotkey daemon) and
  [`yabai`](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) (tiling window manager)
  together. Wasn't as seamless as I thought it would be so fine continuing to
  use [HyperDock](https://bahoom.com/hyperdock/). Also had to do some OS level
  hacks to get them to work that *seemed* a little scary.
* Looked into [`ranger`](https://ranger.github.io/)
